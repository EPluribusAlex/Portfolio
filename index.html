					 	<p>Hello and welcome to my page! I am a full-Stack web developer with a focus on JavaScript and Node.js development. I have worked extensively within the React.js framework, and am also familiar with numerous other view engines, libraries, databases, and tools which help me deliver elegant and responsive web applications. Most of all, I am willing to learn whatever new tools are required to stay competitive and accomplish the tasks before me.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="content-1">
						<p>I have always enjoyed the outdoors and favoured the fresh, mountain air, and due to my desire to preserve nature for the joy it continually provides me, I spent much of my high school summers volunteering with the local state park. Having been born in England (which I lived until I was 5), I desired to return to the UK following high school in NC, so I moved to Cardiff, Wales in 2009 where I spent some time studying physics and math.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="content-2">
						<p>I soon realized, however, that I needed more time to explore what direction I wanted my career to go in, and so I returned to the States in 2012 where the following year I achieved one of my greatest dreams and thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail which extends over 2,100 miles between Georgia and Maine.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I've had a variety of jobs from community gardens, to outdoor day-camps, to strawberry farms, to bookstores, but it was during a trip to Australia where I spent a year with a close friend that I began to consider pursuing a career in programming.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I have always been fascinated with computers, in particular artificial intelligence, and in the autumn of 2017, I decided to pursue training that would help me break into the world of information technology. Thus I entered the Coding Bootcamp hosted by Trinity and the University of North Carolina of Chapel Hill from which I graduated after 6 months of training in May of 2018. I have found that programming really resonates with me, and I am determined to contribute towards this field while expanding my knowledge as much as possible along the way, learning the tools, methods, and frameworks I need to provide the best possible web experience.</p>
